                    I am currently the primary developer for this LAMP stack application (RHEL9; AWS hosted), handling the bulk of the development work through multiple major releases and hotfixes. I've played an essential role in guiding the team through penetration testing and audits, ensuring our systems meet security & accessibility compliance standards and that we demonstrate competency for contract recompete purposes. I regularly communicate with leaders, business analysts, and testers, explaining the code and outlining what needs to be done to maintain and improve the system.
